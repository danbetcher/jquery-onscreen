# jQuery On Screen Plugin

This plugin is a simple way to test if a given element (or part there-of) is inside the bounds of the current viewport. You can use it for all sorts of things, like delaying animations and other javascript from executing until an element is visible to the user - regardless of their device or screen size.

## Example Usage

Use the plugin as follows:
```js
if ($('#element').onScreen()) {
    // Your element is in the Viewport
}
```

This is my first little Open Source contribution, so be gentle with your feedback!
